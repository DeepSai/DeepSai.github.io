## Experience

### Full Stack Data Scientist - IKEA Supply AG

Responsible for all machine learning initiatives in the area of the supply chain within IKEA,
from initial explorations to the deployment and integration of trained models into current
business processes.

### Senior Data Scientist - Ernst & Young (FSO)

As a senior data scientist, I work implementing machine learning algorithms for financial
services organizations, focusing on compliance applications, risks estimations, and improving
customer experience. I also work developing visualization solutions, providing managers and
directors with insights about their running operations.

### Senior Data Analyst - Kernel Analytics

I worked at Kernel analytics as Data engineer/analyst in a wide range of sectors such as
telco, pharma, retail or press. I’ve been involved in projects of sales forecasting, customer
identification and clustering, customer behavior analysis, and anomaly detection, among
other endeavors. I have also worked developing end to end web-based dashboards, from
data model design to front-end visualizations, allowing users to monitor business evolution,
run forecasting simulations, and gain insights on business KPIs.

#### Some projects:
- Analysis and clustering of customer portfolio for a Spanish retailer.
- Development of web-based monitoring dashboards for the telco industry.
- Data traffic optimization for the telco industry.
- Sales forecasting the for press industry.
- Customer behavior analysis for the pharma industry.

### Data Analyst (Freelance) - Science-o-matic
Development of a forecasting model of jellyfish presence in Mediterranean coasts, using
Copernicus database and logistic regression.

### Junior Engineer - Commissariat d'energie atomique (CEA)
I worked at CEA and Abengoa as an engineer, developing an in-house CFD (Computational
Fluid Dynamics) code, and running simulations with the purpose of understanding and
characterizing the coalescence mechanism in liquid-liquid environments, and to simulate
solid colloids suspended in liquids.
